# Form Meaning Pairing with BERT

## Overview
This project aims to measure the overall complexity of languages:
(i) by measuring the unpredictability of what meaning a given form represents in a certain context, and
(ii) based on a linguistic unit that does not depend on any given languages.
The project used [Multilingual Bible Corpus](https://christos-c.com/bible/) as the dataset, and [multilingual BERT model](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased) as the model.<br>
The 41 languages used in the project are ones with a complete text of the Bible included by both the corpus and the model:<br>
Albanian, Afrikaans, Arabic, Bulgarian, Cebuano, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latin, Lithuanian, Malagasy, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, Telugu, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

## Procedure
1. Tokenizing an input dataset into subwords.<br>
   (defalu subword is WordPiece)
2. Embedding each subword.
3. Clustering<br>
   (default clustering method is DBSCAN)
4. Computing Shannon entropy.
5. Visualizing the result with a scatter plot.

## How to Run
The command below is the simplest form:
```
$ python main.py id data-directory
```
, in which `id` refers to the name of directory in which the result will be stored, and `data-directory` to the name of directory that contains a data you want to use.<br>
Data must be a plain text and each line corresponds to a sentence or another kinds of set of linguistic units that represents a context for each word or subword.

options are the below:
- --model_name (str): the name of BERT model you want to use.<br>(DEFAULT=bert-base-multilingual-cased)
- --minimum_frequency (int): the number of the minimum frequency at which a subword in question needs to occur.<br>(DEFAULT=10)
- --brake_trials (int): the number of trials for which you want to stop the processes if the number pf clusters does not vary.<br>(DEFAULT=10)
- --output (bool): If True, the probabilities and entropies of each subword of each language will be output.<br>(DEFAULT=True)
- --pca (bool):If True, embeddings will be compressed with PCA<br>(DEFAULT=False)
